# LAUS: Local Area Unemployment Statistics Analysis (R)

This project explores local unemployment trends in California using the LAUS dataset. The analysis includes linear modeling, time series visualization, statistical testing, and categorical analysis. The work was completed as part of the STAT515 final project.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS)** program provides monthly employment/unemployment estimates for over 7,300 areas in California, including counties, cities, and metro areas. Our analysis provides insights into labor force dynamics, area-specific unemployment trends, and statistical relationships across years.

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. **Linear Relationship**: Is there a linear association between unemployment rate and labor force?
2. **Discrepancy Analysis**: What is the trend of employment discrepancy over time?
3. **Trends by Area Type**: How does the unemployment rate differ by area type (state, sub-county, metro)?
4. **Outlier Detection**: Are there outliers in unemployment rates over the years?

## 📊 Key Analysis & Visualizations

- Linear Regression: Unemployment Rate vs Labor Force
- Line Plots: Employment discrepancy over time
- Bar Plots: Mean unemployment by area type
- Outlier Detection: Highlighting abnormal unemployment years
- Stacked Area Charts: Labor force composition trends
- Time Series Plots: Yearly variation with area distinctions
- Statistical Tests: t-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- R
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- forecast
- ggfortify
- CSV (as data source)

## 📁 File Structure

- `Fin proj code.R`: Core R script for data cleaning, analysis, and plotting.
- `laus.csv`: The LAUS dataset with employment-related metrics.
- `Fin Proj ppt.pptx`: Final presentation slides summarizing methods, findings, and visualizations.

## 📈 Sample Visuals

- 📉 Linear Regression: Labor Force vs Unemployment Rate  
- 📊 Bar Chart: Mean Unemployment by Area Type  
- 📦 Outlier Plot: Highlighting statistical outliers over time  
- 🎯 Chi-Square Test: Association between Area Type and Employment Status

## 📌 Conclusion

California’s labor market demonstrates complex regional patterns and economic behaviors. This analysis not only supports data-driven workforce planning but also showcases the strength of statistical inference in R.
